## My Data Science Portfolio
Hello, I am Konstantinos Zygogiannis and this is a README.md file introducing you to my Data Science Portfolio. This repository showcases a variety of data science projects, assignments, and exercises that I've worked on. Whether you're a recruiter, fellow data scientist, or someone interested in exploring data science, I hope you find these projects insightful and engaging.

The context of this repository is organized as follows:
### Table of contents
- [Kaggle_Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/Konszygo/Portfolio/tree/main/Kaggle_Sales%20Forecasting)

  This folder contains Python scripts for a Kaggle competition focused on time series sales forecasting for a large groceries company located in Ecuador, having multiple stores and multiple products for each store.         Although the project is incomplete, it's a work in progress where I am exploring and applying machine learning techniques to address the challenge of forecasting.
- [Master's degree Projects](https://github.com/Konszygo/Portfolio/tree/main/Master's%20degree%20Projects)

  This folder includes five projects from my master's degree in Statistics and Modeling. The projects are presented in PDF format, while there is also some coding involved in two of them, written in MATLAB. The             corresponding files are provided. Markov chains/models, Time Series and Game Theory (Master's Thesis) constitute the main subjects discussed throughout these projects. Unfortunately, all of the projects in this folder are only written in Greek at the time being (except for the abstract part of my Master's Thesis in Stochastic Games).
  Feel free to explore these academic projects to get an insight into my mathematical and analytical skills.

- [SpaceX Predicting the probability of a rocket landing to its launching pad](https://github.com/Konszygo/Portfolio/tree/main/SpaceX%20Predicting%20the%20probability%20of%20a%20rocket%20landing%20to%20its%20launching%20pad)

  This is a complete Data Science project, starting from data collection and finishing with a presentation in PowerPoint. It is a capstone project, the final part before obtaining Data Science Professional Certificate offered by IBM and Coursera. Both Python and SQL are used for exploratory data analysis, after webscrapping and using SpaceX API to collect the data. Basic ML techniques are used, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine Classification, Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors classification, in order to predict rockets' landing success rate. Lastly, the results are visualized using Folium and Plotly dashboard. 
- [TensorFlow - Predicting House Prices with Regression](https://github.com/Konszygo/Portfolio/tree/main/TensorFlow%20-%20Predicting%20House%20Prices%20with%20Regression)

  This is an introductory project to using TensorFlow, offered by Coursera. Year of sale, age of the house, distance from city center and number of stores are some of the variables used to make predictions. This project covers the basics of data handling, feature selection, train and test splitting,training the model and plotting its predictions. A .csv file of data used as well as a Python script with useful functions are included inside this folder.

- [TensorFlow - Practicing](https://github.com/Konszygo/Portfolio/tree/main/Tensorflow%20-%20Practicing)

  There are 4 Python script files included in this folder, serving as exercises for a Udemy course I have completed, named "Data Science: Modern Deep Learning in Python". These exercises helped me deeply comprehend what a simple multi-layer perceptron is, applying gradient descent on MNIST dataset, compare Full Gradient Descent wth Stochastic Gradient Descent and, finally implement logistic regression with RMSprop with momentum.
  
- [Visualization](https://github.com/Konszygo/Portfolio/tree/main/Visualization)

  Inside this folder, you will find Tableau and PowerBI visualization projects. At the moment, there is only one .pbix file (PoweBI) and one .twbx (Tableau) file. Both of these simple projects are entry-level exercises that introduced me to the most powerful visualization tools. 

### Getting Started

  To explore a specific project, navigate to the corresponding folder and review the README or project files for details.
  If you have any questions or would like to discuss collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I'm excited to share my journey and experiences in data science. If you have any feedback, questions, or ideas for collaboration, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
