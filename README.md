## My Data Science Portfolio
Hello, I am Konstantinos Zygogiannis and this is a README.md file introducing you to my Data Science Portfolio. This repository showcases a variety of data science projects, assignments, and exercises that I've worked on. Whether you're a recruiter, fellow data scientist, or someone interested in exploring data science, I hope you find these projects insightful and engaging.

The context of this repository is organized as follows:
### Table of contents
- [Kaggle_Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/Konszygo/Portfolio/tree/main/Kaggle_Sales%20Forecasting)

  This folder contains Python scripts for a Kaggle competition focused on time series sales forecasting for a large groceries company located in Ecuador, having multiple stores and multiple products for each store. Although the project is incomplete, it's a work in progress where I am exploring and applying machine learning techniques to address the challenge of forecasting.
- [Master's degree Projects](https://github.com/Konszygo/Portfolio/tree/main/Master's%20degree%20Projects)

  This folder includes five projects from my master's degree in Statistics and Modeling. The projects are presented in PDF format, covering various statistical analyses and methodologies applied to real-world data. Feel free to explore these academic projects to get an insight into my statistical and analytical skills.
